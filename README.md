# Using Machine Learning Architectures to Predict Fault Lines in a Seismic Volume

There are various research papers implementing Supervised Learning architectures for image prediction problems. There is an obvious lack of unsupervised methods however, and my thesis aims to compared the two approaches, and determine whether or not it is time to move towards an unsupervised method as the typical solution to these problems.

Included so far is a U-Net image-segmentation architecture. Feel free to peruse!
